CONFIGURING KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS FOR POS SCREEN
Configuring keyboard shortcuts for POS screen
StoreMate supports keyboard shortcuts, by default we have configured shortcuts for different actions in POS screen.
But you can configure it yourself as per your convenience.
To configure keyboard shortcuts, go to Settings -> System Settings. Here in the POS section, you will find a list of Operations and the shortcuts for them.
You can use the Available Key Names with any combination of letters or number to create shortcuts.
Make sure the shortcuts do not conflict (is not same) with the shortcut of the browser. Making a shortcut same as the browser will have different effects in different browsers.
