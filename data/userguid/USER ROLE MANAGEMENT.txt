USER ROLE MANAGEMENT
Adding User Roles & Permission
Every new business comes with some default roles – Admin & Cashier.
Admin has all permissions in the application.
The cashier has permission to only the POS section.
You can create a role by clicking on Add button -> Giving a role name and then selecting the appropriate permission for that role.

Sometimes you may need to give a user access to a/some particular location(s) only. In this case, select the locations from “Access locations” permission. Select “All Locations” to give permission to access all locations for your business.

Roles permissions can be edited & Deleted.

Note: You must update the role of an existing user before deleting a role.
