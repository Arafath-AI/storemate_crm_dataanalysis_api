FIFO (First In First Out) => In this the old stock should be sold first.
LIFO (Last In First Out) => In this the most recent purchase stock should be sold.
For an Example:1. Purchase 20 pcs of product A on 20 March 2018. Expiry date 10 April 20182. Purchase 20 pcs of the same product  A on 23 March 2018. Expiry date 8 April 20183. Today I sold 22 pcs.If the “Stock Accounting Method” is FIFO => Then the Product purchased on 20 March 2018 will be deduced with 20 pcs and after that product purchase on 23 March 2018 will be deduced with 2 pcs.So in stock, we will have products from 23 March 2018 with 18 pcs.If the “Stock Accounting Method” is LIFO => The opposite of the above will happen.NOTE: You must set the required accounting method before selling the item for that accounting method to be used.
